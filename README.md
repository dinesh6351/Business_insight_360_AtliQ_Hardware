## After the Project Kick-off Meetings

The data engineering team has delivered the requested data to the analytics team. Let's dive in and explore the insights within.


## Dataset Understanding

Understanding the available data is crucial for effective analysis. Before diving into analysis, it's essential to grasp the data at hand.

üìå**Dimension Table:** Contains static data such as customer and product details.


üìå**Fact Table:** Contains transactional data.


üìå**gdb041:**

  ‚Ä¢	Dim Customer: Details on markets, customers, platforms, and channels.

  ‚Ä¢	Dim Market: Information on markets, sub-zones, and regions.

  ‚Ä¢	Dim Product: Product divisions, categories, and variants.

  ‚Ä¢	Fact Forecast Monthly: Forecasted customer needs.

  ‚Ä¢	Fact Sales Monthly: Actual sales data.
  

üìå**gdb056:**

  ‚Ä¢	Freight Cost: Travel and other costs for each market.

  ‚Ä¢	Gross Price: Gross prices with product codes.

  ‚Ä¢	Manufacturing Cost: Manufacturing costs with product codes.

  ‚Ä¢	Pre-Invoice Deductions: Pre-invoice deductions percentage for each customer.

  ‚Ä¢	Post-Invoice Deductions: Post-invoice deductions and other details.



## Importing data into PowerBi

The database being MySQL, datasets need to be imported from MySQL database to Power BI by providing the necessary database access credentials.

## Data Model

Data modelling is the foundation of any report, dictating its overall performance. Poor data modelling can significantly impact report efficiency. Following best practices is essential, and in this project, we've adopted the Snowflake data modelling method.
